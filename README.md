Course Outline
Course Introduction and Overview provides an introduction to this course and the Git source control system. Key concepts and the basic workflow are discussed.

Setup and Configuration provides step-by-step instructions on how to setup Git for Windows and Mac OS X, how to use Git's help command, and how to setup the minimum required configuration to start using Git.

In Working with Git Locally, we walk through all the commands needed to start a new project managed by Git (or enable Git for an existing project) all the way through making commits, including common file operations like moving and deleting files. We also cover how to exclude the wrong files from accidentally being committed and how to review your repository's history.

Going Remote covers publishing the locally created repository (previous section) on GitHub. Starting off by setting up SSH authentication, creating the remote version of our repository, linking the local repository with the remote version on GitHub, and finally sending our changes up to remote repository.

Course Features
Presentations provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas. Since few like slide-ware presentations, slide-presentations are kept to a minimum.

Screencasts provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated. There is a total of 56 minutes of video based training in this course (Presentation + Screencasts, excluding Promo Video).

Following each lecture or group of related lectures in the demo sections of the course are Command Listing lectures that serve as reference and reminder of the commands used in the previous lecture(s). Each Command Listing includes the exact listings used in the previous lectures and a reference guide for newly introduced commands. All commands used in this course are available through the Command Listing lectures.

The four Quizzes reinforce the key concepts by testing your newly learned knowledge throughout the course.

Several attachments throughout the course provide supplemental information, illustrations, or other reference material.
